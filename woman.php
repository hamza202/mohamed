                                stipulate the portions for each individual (male and female) eligible to inherit.

identity is preserved and her wealth

Islamic law. When her husband passes away,
she is considered as one of the heirs and not a

                                Muhammad condemned discrimination between male and female children and taught his
                                companions to love their children and raise them properly regardless of their sex. In
                                fact, he emphasized giving more care and attention to female children until they grow up
                                and get married. Muhammad said:

                                Before Islam, women had no right to inherit. Muhammad successfully changed this custom.
                                Females gained the right to inherit like males. However, Muhammad did not create the
                                Islamic inheritance system, but he conveyed God’s Words (preserved in the Quran) which
                                stipulate the portions for each individual (male and female) eligible to inherit.
