                                fact, he emphasized giving more care and attention to female children until they grow up
                                and get married. Muhammad said:

                                Islamic inheritance system, but he conveyed God’s Words (preserved in the Quran) which
                                stipulate the portions for each individual (male and female) eligible to inherit.

Muhammad replied without
hesitation: Aisha.

                                Muhammad described his love to her like a knot firmly tied
                                on a rope. Aisha used to ask Muhammad from time to time
                                “how is the knot” and Muhammad used to confirm his love
                                to her. He said:

                                Muhammad mentioned to Aisha that no
                                one was better than Khadijah at her time, she believed him when he first received God’s
                                revelation but many people did not (some of his uncles and relatives did not believe
                                him). She consoled him with her money and supported him without hesitation.

                                fact that some people may view Muhammad’s comments about his late wife Khadijah as it
                                was triggering jealousy in his current wife Aisha, he was a fair and a loyal husband to
                                his wives.
