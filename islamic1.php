                                    and souls.

                                    Muhammad wasn’t at home and his wife talked to them. However, they found his level
                                    of worship less than what they expected. They thought that a religious way of life
                                    requires focusing on spiritualities and ignoring some of the body needs or depriving
                                    it from natural desires.

                                    Miswak is a common name for Salvadore persica (tooth brush tree, also known as the Arak tree). It is popularly used in Saudi Arabia.

                                    For many centuries, Muslim scientists were the frontiers in pure and applied sciences. Arabic, the language of  the Quran, became the language of sciences that were taught in full-fledged universities granting degrees in chemistry, mathematics, calculus, medicine, astronomy, geography, engineering, art and literature.

He is considered by many scientists to be the father of chemistry. He was the first to discover many acids such as nitric, hydrochloric and sulfuric acids. He described many chemical processes such as evaporation, sublimation and distillation. The historian of chemistry Eric John Holmyard gives credit to Geber for developing alchemy into an experimental science.

His name is the origin of the word guarismo in Spanish and the word algarismo in Portuguese, both meaning digit.

It was translated to different languages and was a standard medical text in Europe for seven centuries (until early 18th century).

According to Donald Routledge Hill, Al-Jazari described the most sophisticated candle clocks. He also invented the water clock and the crank shaft that transforms rotary motion into linear motion.
