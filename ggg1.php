                              Muhammad said: “I swear by God that you will not be true believers in Him unless you love each other. I will tell you something, if you do it you will love each other. Greet each other frequently and make it a common habit." And he said: “No one will become a good believer unless he wishes for his brethren what he likes for himself.” He also said: “Whoever helps a believer overcome a difficulty, God will help him overcome a difficulty on the Day of Judgment, and God will always help an individual as long as he/she is helping others.” 1

But soon he elaborated: “You will be young when you enter the Paradise" (and all people will be).

One time, Muhammad saw a sore-eyed person named Suhayb (who was a Roman Muslim), looking miserable and was eating a ripe date. Muhammad wanted to joke with him in order to cheer him up so he said to him: “How come you eat the date and your left eye is sore?” Suhayb realised that Muhammad was joking with him so he replied: “Don’t worry I am eating it on the right side of my mouth (the side where the right eye was sound)."

Anas Bin Malek narrated that a man came to Muhammad and asked him to give him a ride on a camel. Muhammad said: "I will give you a ride on the child of the she camel". The man replied: "What am I going to do with the camel’s child?" Then Muhammad said: "Are not all camels the children of she camels?" 5

                              Muhammad paid attention to children. He used to greet them and play with them. One time Muhammad saw a little boy who was sad because his little bird died. Although Muhammad was heading elsewhere, he spent some time with the little boy to please him and relieve his sadness.6 Muhammad used to ask parents to express their love to their children by kissing and hugging them and being fair with all their children.

 Muhammad had a Jewish neighbor who did not accept Islam and was not kind to him. When the Jewish neighbor became sick, Muhammad  visited him at his home, which softened his neighbor’s heart. Also, Muhammad visited a Jewish boy at his home when he became sick because the boy had worked for some time as a helper or a servant for Muhammad.(Sahih Al-Bukhari, 2/94, 1356)

“O believers, don’t disdain (or ridicule or deride) each other neither men deride men nor women deride women, the latter could be better than the former. “Don’t defame one another and don’t insult one another and whoever does so and does not repent to Allah he or she is indeed a wrongdoer.”

                            <h3>Adding value through etiquette </h3>
                            <p>
Muhammad cared for behavioral etiquette. He taught his companions that etiquette is part of his example and way of life (Sunnah). In addition, many verses in the Quran urge on tenderness and good manners.  Muhammad  indicated that Angels get upset by what upsets human beings (e.g. loud voices, bad smells, etc.) The following points summarize some of the Islamic behavioral etiquettes:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              • Do not talk loudly and do not walk arrogantly. <br>
                              • Do not stay long when visiting a sick person, give him or her time to rest. <br>
                              • One should smell good when he/she comes to the mosque.<br>
                              • Those who ate garlic or onion should not come to the mosque, so as not to disturb the others by any unfavorable smell or act (e.g. burping). <br>

                            </p>

                        </div>

                          <p>
                            • Be helpful and give space to others in congregation areas where finding a free space is difficult.<br>
                            • Call others with the names and nicknames they like. • Put your hand on your mouth when yawning and bless others when they sneeze.<br>
                            • When talking to others, one should use the best and the most acceptable words to them so as they like it. The good word is a form of charity in Islam. <br>
                            • Talk kindly to your parents and don’t shout at their faces, never say a bad word even “uff or fie” (the smallest negative word in Arabic). <br>
                            • Children should always knock on the door and seek permission to enter, before going into their parents' room at certain times during the day. <br>
                            • If you are serving water to others, you are the last one to drink (a preferred etiquette). <br>
                            • If you are invited for a dinner or a banquet, eat from the closer pots to you and don’t annoy the others. <br>
                            • Don’t breath in a cup of water while drinking from it.

                            Whenever he gave instructions to his followers that  were understood or perceived in two different ways, he used to accept both ways provided that both of them achieve the required goal in a lawful manner.

                            In the battle of "That Al-Salassel", the Muslim Commander Amr Bin Al-Aass was  criticized for leading a prayer without performing ghusul and ablution (he was in a state of spiritual impurity). Muhammad listened to his justification and accepted it. Amr told Muhammad that it was cold that night and if he showered his body, he could fall sick and could not lead his group.

                            Muhammad always consulted his companions and even his wife. He advised his followers to be objective and use rational thinking. He empowered them and involved them in the decision making process.

                            Although that was a foreign concept never applied before in Arabia and it was put forward by an ordinary person, Muhammad considered it seriously and it was approved by the majority of Muslims. They dug a trench 5.5 km long x 4.6 m wide.

Muhammad encouraged his companions to be friendly and transparent with people of other faiths while maintaining an assertive personality and clear understanding about their Islamic faith.

                            Muhammad demonstrated how highly he respected people regardless of their faith in several occasions. It is narrated that he stood up showing respect for a funeral carrying a coffin of a Jewish man that passed him and his companions. Muhammad answered a companion who wondered why Muhammad stood up for the carried body: “He is a human being” (regardless of his race, faith and social class).

                          <p>
                           Interfaith dialogue can be defined as a two way communication or discussion between people of different religious faiths and traditions in order to reach positive outcomes such as moving from suspicion and confusion to understanding and awareness or from hostility to friendliness.

                          <p>
                            In the year 632 CE, Muhammad  received and  hosted at his mosque in the city of “Madinah” a Christian delegation who came from Najran (in Yemen)  to learn about Islam and discuss the differences between Islam and  Christianity.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Muhammad set guidelines and etiquettes for dialogue and debate with others, based on respect, wisdom, mutual understanding and kindness. The Quran states:

                          <p>
In the old city of Jerusalem, a great example of religious tolerance has been existing for many centuries. It started when the second Muslim ruler of the Islamic state Caliph Omar Bin Al-Khattab took over Jerusalem (638 CE) peacefully without shedding a drop of blood. Omar was invited by the Archbishop of Jerusalem, Sophronius, to pray in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.  The Church is also known as the Church of the Resurrection (Anastasis to Eastern Orthodox Christians). It is the holiest

Christian site in the world. It encompasses Calvary where the Christians believe Jesus was crucified, and the tomb (sepulcher) where he was buried. It has been an important pilgrimage destination since the 4th century, C.E.

Omar instead prayed a few yards outside the church. His act confirmed the peaceful coexistence between Islam and other religions. It confirmed freedom of worship for non Muslims under the Islamic state.

                            A mosque was built on that site where Omar prayed to commemorate this historical event (later, it was called Omar Mosque).

                            Caliph Omar entrusted the custody of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, to 'Ubadah Ibn Al-Samit, a companion of prophet Muhammad who became the first Muslim judge of Jerusalem. Ubadah died in the year 658CE and was buried in the “Gate of Mercy” cemetery at the southern corner of the wall enclosing the Noble Sanctuary. The Sanctuary includes the Dome of the Rock and Aqsa Mosque.

Their churches shall not be occupied, demolished nor taken away wholly or in part. They shall neither be coerced in their religion nor shall any of them be injured.

Soon after he arrived in Madinah, Muhammad instructed his companions to buy a piece of land and dedicate it for free trade. People used to buy and sell in it without paying any fees or custom charges.  They called it Manakha.
