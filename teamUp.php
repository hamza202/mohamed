    "Envy is forbidden except in two cases (you wish to have the same thing others have but no bad wishes to them). The first one is a man on whom God bestowed wealth and he spends it righteously. The second case is a man on whom God bestowed wisdom and he acts according to it and teaches it to others." (Bukhari, 73/15)

This is a charity for him."  (Bukhari, 1445/30)

(This is applicable to both males and females) (Narrated by Muslim, Tirmithi, Nassa’i)
