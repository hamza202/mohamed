        Zamzam is the name of mineral water that comes out of a well 20 meters east of Ka'bah in the Sacred Mosque in the city of Makkah. Muslims believe that it was miraculously generated thousands of years ago when Ibrahim’s son Ishmael was thirsty and kept crying and kicking the ground until water gushed out (after his mother Hagar spent a lot of time looking for water).

        Zamzam water is slightly alkaline (pH=7.5) and has a distinct taste. (Please note that drinking de-mineralized water such as distilled waters will create an acid pH in the stomach and intestines. Also, it will aggravate acid reflux.)
