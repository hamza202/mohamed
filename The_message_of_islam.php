                                    “Islam” means submission and devotion to One God. It is a religion of monotheism
                                    where
                                    the adherent to Islam believes that God is one and incomparable. He has no partners
                                    or
                                    sons. He begets not nor was he begotten (neither gives birth nor was born). He
                                    created
                                    the whole universe and all beings. No one shares with Him His Divinity and no one
                                    has
                                    the right to be worshiped or prayed to but Him alone.

                                    His name is "Allah". It is pronounced Allaah with a long vowel “a”. Also, God has
                                    many
                                    beautiful names and attributes. Some of these attributes were mentioned in the Old
                                    Testament. For example, the name Quddous in Arabic is similar to the name Qadosh or
                                    Hakkadosh in Hebrew, which means "The Holy". The name Ahad in Arabic is similar to
                                    the
                                    name Echad in Hebrew, which means "The One". In Islam, God is often described as
                                    "The
                                    Most Gracious, The Most Merciful".

                                                Prophet Muhammad defined a Muslim as “the one whom other people are safe
                                                from harm coming from his tongue and hands”, i.e. people should not
                                                receive
                                                any harm from his actions and words.

                                    In Islam, “The Peace” is one of the magnificent names and attributes of God (Allah).
                                    The
                                    one who submits to Allah should find inner peace within him/ herself and should be
                                    at
                                    peace with the environment and the people.

                                    It is interesting to know that in a Muslim society, people greet each other with the
                                    word “ Assalamo Alaykom” which means “peace be upon you” instead of the words “Hi”
                                    or
                                    “Hello”. The full version of this statement is “peace be upon you as well as Allah’s
                                    mercy and blessings”.
