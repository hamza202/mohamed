                                    “Islam” means submission and devotion to One God. It is a religion of monotheism
                                    where
                                    the adherent to Islam believes that God is one and incomparable. He has no partners
                                    or
                                    sons. He begets not nor was he begotten (neither gives birth nor was born). He
                                    created
                                    the whole universe and all beings. No one shares with Him His Divinity and no one
                                    has
                                    the right to be worshiped or prayed to but Him alone.

                                    His name is "Allah". It is pronounced Allaah with a long vowel “a”. Also, God has
                                    many
                                    beautiful names and attributes. Some of these attributes were mentioned in the Old
                                    Testament. For example, the name Quddous in Arabic is similar to the name Qadosh or
                                    Hakkadosh in Hebrew, which means "The Holy". The name Ahad in Arabic is similar to
                                    the
                                    name Echad in Hebrew, which means "The One". In Islam, God is often described as
                                    "The
                                    Most Gracious, The Most Merciful".

                        Prayer (Salat) in Islam is an act of worship that enables the individual to communicate with his creator and get close to Him. There are five daily-prescribed prayers in Islam, which are distributed during the whole day cycle. The essence of worship is to glorify, exalt and praise God with the heart, tongue and body.

                          In fact, the word ‘salat’ literally means ‘hot connection’. It is a practical demonstration of faith.  Each prayer includes physical movements of bowing and prostrating to Allah. Prayer show progressively increasing levels of submission to Allah. It requires full concentration and isolation from worldly matters. Prophet Muhammad said: "A person is closest to Allah during prostration."

                          Praying five times a day may seem excessive to some people. In reality, it is a  type of meditation that does not take more than forty minutes a day. Just as we eat three or four times a day and we never complain because we need physical nourishment to survive, we also need spiritual nourishment for our soul. Salat at spaced intervals throughout the day provides such spiritual nourishment.

                        Zakat is an essential pillar of Islam. It means giving alms (paying a charity) once every year to poor, needy and other rightful beneficiaries as stipulated by the Quran. It is specified with (2.5%) of excess personal wealth.
                      <br>  Zakat cleanses one's heart from greed and removes hatred and jealousy from the hearts of the poor. It fosters social integration and collaboration, compassion and respect. It enhances the wellbeing of the whole society and achieves social justice.

                        Muslims are required to fast the whole lunar month of Ramadan (29 or 30 days), from the break of dawn to sunset. During the fasting time, Muslims are required to  abstain from eating, drinking and sexual contact while practicing a normal life.
Fasting for the sake of Allah helps acknowledging that the sustenance (that may be taken for granted) actually comes directly from Allah.
When people feel the pangs of hunger, they experience the suffering needy people go through specially in areas that starve or lack the basic sustenance. The rich will be more inclined to give charity when they fast. This builds up a relationship between the rich and the poor and helps build social harmony.
Fasting enables one to curb the inner desires, learn self-control and hence achieve better spiritual development. Fasting has many health benefits and doctors recommend it to cure some diseases.
