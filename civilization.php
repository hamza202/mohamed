                                Muhammad called for maintaining the right balance between materialism and spiritualism.

                                He called for a balanced way of life, balanced views and rational thinking. It is
                                narrated that three people came to his house to ask about his style of worship. Muhammad
                                wasn’t at home and his wife talked to them. However, they found his level of worship
                                less than what they expected.
                                <br>
                                They thought that a religious way of life requires focusing on spiritualities and
                                ignoring some of the body needs or depriving it from natural desires.
                                <br>
                                According to their understanding, a religious person needs to stay single and must not
                                get married. Also, he or she needs to fast every day and perform every night extra
                                prayers besides the daily prayers.
                                <br>
                                When Muhammad knew what they said, he was upset but he stated that he usually performed
                                extra prayers at night and rested like other people. In addition to the annual fasting
                                in the month of Ramadan, he fasted for some time and he did not fast for other times.
                                Finally, he got married and did not like people to stay single. He said:

                                Performing “Ghusul” (washing the whole body) on a regular basis is strongly recommended
                                and is considered as part of Muhammad’s Sunnah (teachings and way of life). However,
                                Ghusul is a must for purity on certain occasions (e.g. after marital contact and
                                menstruation).

                                Muhammad emphasized cleanliness and purification in all aspects of life. He asked his
                                companions to clean their homes and surroundings regularly. He taught them that removing
                                harm or garbage from the road is a rewardable charity act.
                                <br>
                                Also, Muhammad urged his companions to maintain high personal hygiene and cleanliness.
                                His sayings in this context indicate the following:
                            </p>

                                Miswak is a common name for Salvadore persica (tooth brush tree, also known as the Arak
                                tree). It is popularly used in Saudi Arabia. Miswak wicks clean between the teeth and do
                                not break under pressure, rather they are flexible and strong.

                                The chemical analysis of Miswak shows that it contains many useful minerals and elements
                                such as fluorides in large amounts, silica, vitamin C and small quantities of chlorides,
                                tannins, saponins, flavenoids and sterols.

                                            bleeding of gums. The Miswak stick releases fresh sap and silica (hard
                                            glossy material) which acts as an abrasive material to remove stains. Miswak
                                            can clean teeth gently and effectively, whitens the teeth without harming
                                            enamel or gum.

                                            The chloride content helps remove the plaque and tartar stains and vitamin C
                                            contributes to the healing and repair of the tissues. It is believed that
                                            Miswak extract relieves headache, common cold, nausea, tensions, and
                                            dizziness.
