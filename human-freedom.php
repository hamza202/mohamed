                                Slavery existed before Muhammad’s time. In fact, it was
                                part of many social systems
                                in the world. Slaves were
                                considered as assets and
                                part of people’s wealth.
                                Since Islam protects peoples’
                                wealth and property, slavery
                                was gradually abandoned.

                                In the early days of Islam, abusing and mistreating a slave
                                was considered a sin that required repentance to God
                                by releasing the slave free.2
                                In addition, repentance from
                                violations of many Islamic rules required releasing slaves
                                or buying a slave from someone and freeing him or her.
                                This had continued until slavery was fully abolished.

                                the sake of God. On one occasion, Muhammad saw a
                                person called “Abu Mas’ud Al-Badri” hitting and lashing his
                                slave. Muhammad said to him firmly:

                                Mas’ud cooled down and said to Muhammad in an
                                apologetic language: “I will release him for the sake of
                                God.” Muhammad said to him: “If you don't do that, the

                                Prophet Muhammad introduced
                                and taught people Sharia Law, i.e. God's
                                Law that regulates people's life and controls
                                their dealings and transactions. He emphasized that all
                                people should respect the law and the offenders must
                                be punished regardless of their social standing. When the
                                law is applied justly, all people enjoy justice and security.

                                The Prophet made clear that no

                                his own relatives. For example,
                                theft and robbery are an attack
                                on people's properties. Offenders
                                must be punished regardless
                                of their race and social class.
                                Muhammad stated clearly that he would punish his
                                beloved daughter Fatima if she stole from anyone.

                                On one occasion, an Arab man called To’mah Bin Ubayriq
                                stole a metal shield which was part of a suit of armour and
                                hid it in the house of his Jewish friend. The Jewish person
                                was accused of stealing the metal shield
                                but he denied the charge and accused
                                To’mah.

                                against the Jewish man but Islamic justice prevailed.
                                To’mah was proved guilty and the Jewish man was proved
                                to be innocent. In this context, a verse was revealed in the
                                Quran asserting justice:
