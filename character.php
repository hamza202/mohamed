                                Muhammad was an Arab of noble lineage with a white complexion and a rosy tinge. He was a
                                little taller than average and well built with broad shoulders. His belly never
                                protruded out from his chest. He walked briskly and firmly. Muhammad’s companions
                                described him as a handsome person with prominent forehead, high tipped nose, long
                                eyelashes, large black eyes with well set teeth and a pleasant smile. He had slightly
                                curly hair and a thick beard. His hair was black but included few white hairs. His
                                companions indicated that he had a friendly bright face that looked like a full moon. He
                                did not laugh loudly; his laugh was mostly a smile that would show his teeth a bit like
                                hailstones. His cheerfulness and open personality were felt by all people.

                                    words. He spoke with excellence, and there was no excess in it and no abnormal brevity.

                                    When he emphasized a point, he used to repeat it three times with a gesture. He spoke of

                                Muhammad kept his feelings under firm control. When annoyed, he would turn aside or keep
                                silent. When someone committed an act that violates God’s law, he used to show serious
                                anger and a firm stand. No one would stand against his anger in matters of the Lord’s
                                truth being opposed, he would stand fast in protecting the truth as revealed in the
                                Quran. Muhammad never got angry for his own sake.

                                Muhammad was always the first to greet others and would not withdraw his hand from a

                                Whoever saw him unexpectedly would admire and revere him. And whoever socialized or
                                associated with him familiarly, loved him. He was gentle by nature. He was neither
                                coarse nor disdainful of anyone.
                                <br><br>
                                When he looked at the others, he looked at them in full face. If someone called him he
                                didn't turn his face only, but gave attention with his whole body.
                                <br><br>
                                When he used to visit a group, he would sit in the nearest available spot.

                                He did not like reserving seats for others and he ordered his companions to follow his
                                practice.
                                <br><br>
                                Also, he used to give those seated near him his full share of attention in such a way
                                that no one would think others had been given precedence over him.
                                <br><br>
                                He was fair with his companions and all people. They were distinguished only by virtue

                                When at home, he would divide his time into three parts: One for God, one for his
                                family, and one for himself. He always joined in household work and would at times mend
                                his clothes, repair his shoes and sweep the floor. He used to dress well and smell good.

                                After dawn prayers, he preferred sitting in the mosque reciting the Quran and praises of
