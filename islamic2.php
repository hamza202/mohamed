                                        Muhammad had a Jewish neighbor who did not accept Islam and was not kind to him.
                                    When the Jewish neighbor became sick, Muhammad visited him at his home, which
                                    softened his neighbor’s heart. Also, Muhammad visited a Jewish boy at his home when
                                    he became sick because the boy had worked for some time as a helper or a servant for
                                    Muhammad.
