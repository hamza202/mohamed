                                    before him. The main miracle he brought was the Quran, which was a book recited in
                                    original Arabic as a divine revelation from God. Despite the resistance he received
                                    from his own people who spoke Arabic, he and his companions conveyed Islam to

                                    contains the Words of God without being rephrased by His Messenger or anyone else.

                                    an eternal miracle that can be touched, seen, read and conveyed from one generation
                                    to another.

  It is to be noted that the reference of God to Himself as" We" in many verses in the Quran is necessarily understood in the Arabic language to denote grandeur and power. In the English language this is known as the Royal We, where a plural pronoun is used to refer to a single person. On the other hand, the Qura'n frequently uses the word "say" which means " Say to them O Muhammad."
