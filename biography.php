followers. He used to meet them at Al-Arqam House which
was like a small college. He taught them values and morals

Muhammad saw the suffering and tribulation some of
his followers endured and advised them to seek refuge
in Abyssinia, describing it as a land of virtue ruled by a fair
Christian king, under whom no one was treated unjustly.<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="colorh2">Two influential men embraced Islam : </span><br><br>Two strong and
well respected Meccan men accepted Islam, Omar Bin AlKhattab

Hamza became a strong supporter and protector for
Muhammad until he (Hamza) died in the battle of Uhud
(625 CE). Three years after the passing away of Prophet
Muhammad, Omar became the second caliph and ruled
the Islamic state for 11 years.

Muhammad met six people from

They believed Muhammad and returned to their city with
intentions to invite more people from their own tribe and
other tribes in Yathrib. They agreed to return to Makkah

Muhammad “the Prophet and the Messenger of God”.<br><br>

(1) not to worship anyone except Allah (2) not to steal, (3)
not to commit adultery, (4) not to kill, (5) not to slander

The group went back to Yathrib and invited their tribal
leaders and their people to accept Islam. They returned
again in the following year (622 CE) at the time of pilgrimage
with more than 70 men and two women. A similar
pledge of allegiance was given by this group to Prophet
Muhammad.<br><br>
A new Muslim community formed 400 km north of
Makkah: The leaders of the two main tribes in Yathrib (Aws
& Khazraj) embraced Islam and subsequently their people
became Muslims. Muhammad the Prophet of God was
invited to come to Yathrib and become its ruler and leader.

Muhammad, “The Messenger of God” became the ruler of

The people of Yathrib were a mix of Arabs
and Jews. Although there were two main
Arab tribes and three smaller Jewish tribes,

After the migration of the Meccan Muslims, Yathrib no
longer belonged to a certain group of Arabs, instead, it
became the homeland of believers who accepted Islam.<br><br> 
Since there were Jewish tribes in Yathrib and
other Arab people who didn't embrace Islam,
Muhammad did not call it the city of Islam. Instead,
it was named “Al-Madinah” which means “The City”,
in which all inhabitants had similar citizenship
rights.<br><br> <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="colorh2">
Muhammad called for peace and unity in Madinah</span>
In his first public address to the people of Madinah,
Muhammad delivered a very concise speech which
promoted harmony and social cohesion. He said:<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="colorh2">
“O People, seek and spread peace and offer food to each
other, look after your kinship and pray to God at night while
others are sleeping so you gain God’s pleasure and enter His
Paradise”. </span><br><br>
Muhammad linked these acts to
God’s pleasure in order to motivate
people to love each other and live in
peace and harmony in a multicultural
society.

    When Muslims migrated

The chiefs of Makkah used the confiscated money in
trade and business. Muslims knew about a trade caravan
belonging to the Meccan chiefs, led by their enemy AbuSufyan,
which would pass through a trade route close to
Madinah.<br><br>
Muhammad called upon Muslims to take the caravan in
return for their wealth that was confiscated in Makkah. A
force of only 313 Muslims took up the mission. The Meccan
intelligence advised Abu-Sufyan to change the route of
the trade caravan. In addition, Makkah sent an army of 950
soldiers to fight the Muslim force, which was not prepared
for war and was far less equipped than the Meccan army.<br><br>
It was astonishing and beyond expectation that Muslims
won their first battle against the Meccan chiefs. Many

his followers in the battle of trench: </span>
This battle is also
called the “Battle of Confederates”. Since Muhammad
was not killed in the previous battle, Meccan chiefs and
some Arab & Jewish tribes called for a united effort and a
comprehensive assault to kill Muhammad and destroy the
Muslim community.<br><br>
10,000 soldiers marched towards Madinah. After consulting
his companions, Muhammad decided to adopt the
proposal of a Persian Muslim named Salman to dig a
trench on the northern access of Madinah (5.5 km long X
4.6 m wide).<br><br>
Muslims were in their most awkward situation and tried their
best including psychological warfare to defend themselves.
After a month-long siege the Meccan army and its allies
became impatient and strong storms and wind blew, which
forced the confederates to pack up their tents and withdraw.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="colorh2">Treaty of Hudaybiya, a truce for 10
years: </span>
One year after the battle of trench,
Muhammad took a peaceful initiative to
perform Umrah (visit the Sacred Mosque in
Makkah and perform other religious rites).
Visiting Makkah for the purpose of worship
was a religious right that Makkah undertook to give to all
people in Arabia. <br><br>
It was a great surprise for Meccan chiefs to see Muhammad
approaching Makkah with 1400 civilians coming from
Madinah.<br><br>
After several negotiations, a truce was made between the
Meccan chiefs and Muhammad for 10 years during which
time Muhammad and his companions returned
to their homes with a condition to come again
to visit Makkah in the following year (628 CE).
The truce had many other terms which were
disappointing for Muslims because they
weighed heavily in favor of the Meccan side.

The truce was a golden chance for

Muhammad sent delegations to other Arab tribes in Arabia
and wrote letters to the rulers and kings of neighboring
countries and superpowers
such as Persia, Byzantine
and Egypt inviting them
to accept Islam as “the
Message of God”. Muslims
increased in numbers as
people found the truth in
Islam.

    Within less than 2 years,
the truce was broken from the Meccan side when their
allies killed 20 Muslims.<br><br>
In response to this shocking act, Muhammad marched
with 10,000 Muslims to conquer Makkah but asked his
soldiers not to fight any one unless they were fought.7<br>
The Meccan chiefs were
embarrassed and were
not prepared to fight
the Muslims. When the
Muslim army arrived
in Makkah, Muhammad
addressed the whole people of
Makkah confirming the oneness of God, referring victory
to Him and reminding people that all of them descended
from Adam and Adam was created from dust of the
ground.
<br><br>
Then he asked the people of Makkah: “What do you expect
me to do with you? They replied: “We hope for the best.
After all, you have been a gracious brother and a courteous
cousin”.
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="colorh2">Exemplar of forgiveness :</span> Despite the hardship caused
by the Meccan people during the previous 21 years,
Muhammad behaved with high moralities. He replied:
“Have no fear today. Depart then (to your homes), you are
free”. Muhammad’s address was very influential and many
people came to him to make a pledge and embrace Islam.
(Sunan Al-Bayhaqi, 9/118, 18342, 18343)

    After the peaceful takeover
of Makkah, delegations from all over Arabia came to learn
about Islam. Except the Hawazen tribe, who fought the
Muslims and eventually lost the battle of Hunayn, most
Arab tribes embraced Islam. Muhammad sent many of
his companions to various provinces in Arabia to teach
people Islam “The Message of God”.<br><br>

Then he asked the people of Makkah: “What do you expect

cousin”.
When Prophet Muhammad returned to Makkah, his main goal was
to purify the Sacred Mosque. He knocked down all idols that were
worshipped by the Arabs and restored the Ka'bah as the House of Allah,
the One God.</span></p>
