At Muhammad’s time nobody knew anything about the creation of the universe and the motion of the planets and whether the earth was flat or round. Muslims believe that God, the Creator of the universe, is the only One, Who knows how it was created. Fourteen centuries ago, the Quran mentioned the creation of the universe, the motion of the sun and the the moon, the rotation of the earth and the formation of day and night.

                                Modern science explains the creation of the universe by the “Big Bang theory” which is supported by observational and experimental data gathered over decades. According to the “Big Bang theory” the whole universe was initially one big mass then there was a huge explosion which resulted in the formation of galaxies out of agglomerated clouds of celestial matter in a smoke or gaseous form.

In 1925, American astronomer Edwin Hubble provided observational evidence that stars are moving away from each other which implies that galaxies and the whole universe is expanding. Also, it is an established scientific fact that planets move in elliptical orbits around the sun and rotate around their axes.

Verse 25, Chapter 18 (The Cave) in the Quran talks about the seven sleepers and states that they spent 300 years in the cave and additional “9 years”.  Nobody knew during Muhammad’s time why the verse didn’t state the total number as “309 years” instead of the above expression.

  “The Romans have been defeated at the nearest/ lowest land but they will gain victory within a few years.

     At Muhammad’s time, it is virtually impossible for Arabs to predict how the development of the conflict would be between the two superpowers (at their time) within the next ten years and whether a defeated empire can restore victory within a few years. It is a historical fact that the Persian Empire defeated the Roman Empire in the period (614-619 CE) in Palestine area and captured Jerusalem. But within a few years, the Romans had restored victory over the Persians at Nineveh (a city in Iraq).
