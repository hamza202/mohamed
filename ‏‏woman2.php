                            A man can marry a second wife if he
can demonstrate full respect, justice
and impartiality to his wives. Verse
3, Chapter 4 in the Quran indicates
clearly that a man cannot marry more
than one woman if he cannot treat them
rightly and impartially.

                            Prophet Muhammad
was married to more than 4 wives before this revelation.
Being wives of the “Messenger of God” was a great honour
to them besides their being regarded as the mothers of
believers. God revealed in the Quran
that Muhammad's wives were lawful to
him. However, no more women could be
married to Prophet Muhammad even if
he divorced any of his wives.

mothers of believers).

His Messenger and performed righteous
deeds, she would receive double rewards.

chapter 33 verses 28,29) to give his wives two options,
either be released (i.e. divorced) if any of them desired
the world’s life and its adornment, or stay married to
Prophet Muhammad and devote their lives fully for the
cause of Islam.

away, none of them remarried.
