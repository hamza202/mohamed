                                Muhammad sent letters to the rulers and kings of neighboring countries and superpowers
                                such as Persia, Byzantine and Egypt calling them to accept Islam as “the Message of
                                God”. When Heraclius King of Byzantine received Muhammad’s letter, he invited Abu-Sufyan
                                (one of the main chiefs and tradesmen of Makkah who was by chance doing business in that
                                area) to attend him. Heraclius asked Abu-Sufyan a few questions and requested him to be
                                honest.

                                It is believed that the first building for worshipping one God was established when Adam
                                first descended on the earth. Muslims believe that the most important person who rebuilt
                                this building and raised its walls was Prophet Abraham together with his son Ishmael.
                                The building is cubical in shape and it is called “Ka’bah”. It is located in Makkah,
                                which is currently in Saudi Arabia. God imposed a duty upon Abraham and his son to
                                purify the Ka’bah for those who pray, meditate and prostrate to Him. God made it a place
                                of worship, and a sanctuary (a safe place and a resort) for the people
                            </p>

                                            seek refuge from you to God, The Beneficent One if at all you fear Him. He
                                            said: I am none other than a messenger of your Lord to grant you a pure boy.
                                            She said: How shall I have a boy (son) and neither a human being has ever
                                            touched me nor have I been unchaste! He said: So (it will be). Your Lord
                                            said: It is easy for Me and We will make him a miraculous sign for all
                                            people and a Mercy from Us. It is a decreed matter. Soon she conceived him,
                                            and she hurried to a remote place but the birth pangs drove her unto the
                                            trunk of the palm tree. She said: Oh, I wish I had died before this and had
                                            become a thing utterly forgotten!

                                According to the story mentioned in the Quran, Mary brought her son to her own people
                                who blamed her but Jesus (the newborn) miraculously spoke and said: chapter 19 : Verses
                                30-35, Mary:

                                            Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He (decreed) to give me the Scripture and
                                            make me a prophet and make me blessed wherever I may be. And He enjoined me
                                            to pray to him and give alms as long as I am alive and to be virtuous
                                            towards my mother. He didn’t make me insolent or wretched. May all peace be
                                            upon me the day I was born and the day I will die and the day I shall be
                                            raised alive. That is Jesus son of Mary; it is the truth concerning what
                                            they doubt. It is not for God to take any son (Exalted Be He). When He
                                            decrees a matter, He but says to it : Be and so it is.
