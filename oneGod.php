                          Islam acknowledges all prophets and messengers God sent before Muhammad for the guidance of humanity. They confirmed one message, monotheism, which is the belief in God's existence and oneness. God sent them to  educate people about the purpose of life, protect them from falling astray and teach them good morals. The Quran mentioned 25 prophets and messengers by name and focused on the stories of some of them. For example, in the Quran Adam was mentioned 25 times, Noah was mentioned 43 times, Abraham was mentioned 69 times, Moses was mentioned 136 times and Jesus was mentioned 25 times.

Muhammad said: "My similitude in comparison with the other prophets before me, is that of a man who has built and completed a house except for a place of one missing brick. When people see the house, they admire its beauty and say: how splendid the house will be if the missing brick is put in its place. So I am that brick, and I am the last of the Prophets. "

                          Say : We have believed in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed unto Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob and the tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and that which the Prophets received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered.

                          Believing in God’s revealed Books before the Quran is an essential pillar of the Islamic faith. Muslims believe that the Quran does not contradict the previous revelations but it does point out and correct deviations from truth that happened through the history.

We did reveal the Torah, where in it there is guidance and a light. The Quran, 5:44 And We sent following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary confirming that which came before him in the Torah, and We gave him the Gospel in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah as guidance and instructions for the righteous. The Quran, 5:46 And unto you (Muhammad) We revealed the Book (The Quran) with the truth, confirming whatever Scripture was before it, and a watcher (criterion) over it. The Quran, 5:48 Those whom God bestowed favor among the Prophets, of the descendents of Adam and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Noah, and of the seed of Abraham and Israel, and from among those whom We guided and chose.

                                      Abraham is considered as the father of prophets in the Jewish, Christian and Islamic religions because most of the known prophets were from his offspring. Muslims believe that prophet Muhammad is his descendent through his first son Ishmael who was also the father of many Arab tribes. On the other hand, the nation of Israel and many prophets such as Jacob, Joseph, Aaron and Moses have descended from his second son Isaac.
                                      The Quran frequently mentioned the story of Abraham, who used personal observation, reason and common sense to search for the truth. He recognized that God cannot be the sun, or the moon or any idol or creature. God is the creator of the universe and all beings. He is the only deity that is worthy to be worshipped. He is one and He has no partners.  Abraham dedicated his life and struggled to teach people monotheism. He practically proved his sincerity, honesty, thankfulness and obedience to God. He presented one of the greatest and most memorable examples in the history for full submission to One God, the Lord of lords and all beings.

God guided him to the right religion and made him an “Imam” i.e. a leader for people (Quran, 2:124) and described him as a nation (Quran, 16:120).
  Abraham is revered by Muslims as the person who gave them their name as "Muslims" (i.e. those who believe in One God and submit to Him) (Quran, 22:78).

It is believed that the first building for worshipping one God was established when Adam first descended on the earth. Muslims believe that the most important person who rebuilt this building and raised its walls was Prophet Abraham together with his son Ishmael. The building is cubical in shape and it is called “Ka’bah”. It is located in Makkah, which is currently in Saudi Arabia. God imposed a duty upon Abraham and his son to purify the Ka’bah for those who pray, meditate and prostrate to Him. God made it a place of worship, and a sanctuary (a safe place and a resort) for the people
