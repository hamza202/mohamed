                                “Of humble origins, Muhammad founded and promulgated one of the world’s great religions
                                and became an immensely effective political leader. Today, thirteen centuries after his
                                death, his influence is still powerful and pervasive. The majority of persons in this
                                book, had the advantage of being born and raised in centers of civilization, highly
                                cultured and politically pivotal nations”.

                                “It is this unparalleled combination of secular and religious influence
                                which I feel entitles Muhammad to be considered the most influential single
                                figure in human history.”

                                Muhammad however was born in the year 570 CE, in the city of Mecca, in southern Arabia,
                                at that time a backward area of the world, far from the centers of trade, art and

                                Muslims dislike the descriptions of Prophet Muhammad as a "founder of a religion".

                                the combined influence of Jesus Christ and St. Paul on Christianity. On the purely
                                religious level, then it seems likely that Muhammad has been as influential in human
                                history as Jesus.”

                            <p>
                                In the year 630 CE, Muhammad gained victory over the Speaking objectively about
                                Muhammad, the French writer and politician Alphonse de Lamartine wrote in his book
                                Histoire de la Turquie:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                “Never has a man proposed for himself, voluntarily or involuntarily, a goal more
                                sublime, since this goal was beyond measure: undermine the superstitions placed between
                                the creature and the Creator, give back God to man and man to God, reinstate the
                                rational and saintly idea of divinity in the midst of this prevailing chaos of material
                                and disfigured gods of idolatry. Never has a man accomplished in such a short time such
                                an immense and long lasting revolution in the world”.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                “If the grandeur of the aim, the smallness of the means, the
                                immensity of the result are the three measures of a man’s
                                genius, who would dare humanly compare a great man of
                                modern history with Muhammad?”
                                <br><br>
                                Lamartine also indicated that Muhammad didn’t move
                                weapons and empires to create a material power but
                                he moved ideas, beliefs, and souls. He founded upon a
                                Book, of which each letter has become a law, a spiritual

                            <p>
                                When Muhammad migrated to Madinah with his close
                                companion Abu Bakr (622 CE), the Meccan leaders
                                announced a large reward of 100 camels for anyone who
                                could bring Muhammad dead or alive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unfortunately Muhammad and his
                                companion were tracked down by one
                                of the Arab knights named Suraqah
                                bin Malik who was tempted by the big
                                reward. On the way, his horse stumbled
                                and he fell on the ground a few times. He
                                considered these unusual incidents as
                                an indirect message that Muhammad
                                probably had been supported by
                                divine power.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When Suraqah approached
                                Muhammad, Muhammad said to
                                him: “Do return to your people and
                                I promise you that one day (under the umbrella of the
                                Islamic state) you would wear the bangles (bracelets) of
                                Chosroes, the Persian ruler."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Suraqah asked in wonderment if Muhammad meant the
                                bangles of Khusrow bin Hormuz, the emperor of Iran.
                                Muhammad replied "yes" with full confidence. He had a
                                strong faith that the religion of Islam would reach Persia
                                and would be known all over the world.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Suraqah returned back
                                to Makkah but he didn’t
                                embrace Islam until
                                Muhammad took over
                                Makkah peacefully 8 years
                                later (year 630 CE).

                            <p>
                                Muhammad passed away
                                in the year 632 CE and his
                                promise to Suraqah was
                                believed by his companions
                                as genuine and would happen one day.

                                Persia in the year 642 CE and all the treasures of Khusrow,
                                the emperor of Persia fell in the hands of Omar.

                                companions to bring him in. (20 years passed since this
                                story took place and Suraqah had become an old man)...

                                promise is fulfilled."
                                <br><br>
                                Suraqah cried and every one wept.
                                Muhammad’s promise became a
                                reality 10 years after he passed away.
                                <br><br>
                                Meccan chiefs and entered Makkah peacefully. He returned
                                home not to live there for the rest
                                of his life but to clear paganism
                                and liberate or restore the original
                                purpose of Ka’bah (the cubical
                                building that was established by
                                Prophet Abraham to worship one
                                God). He removed all idols from
                                around the Ka’ bah and asked his
                                companion Bilal to climb on top of
                                the Ka’bah and call:
                                <br><br>
                                God is Greatest, God is Greatest, I witness that there is no
                                deity but Allah and I witness that Muhammad is His
                                messenger.
                                Muhammad wanted the key for the Ka’bah
                                door, so he called Othman Bin Talha (of Bani-Shayba family) who was the keeper of the
                                Ka’bah key. It is
                                important to know that there was a treaty before Islam in
                                which the honour of being a custodian or a warden of the
                                Ka’bah was given to the family of Bani Shayba. This honour
                                and responsibility was passed from the grandfathers to the
                                sons in the same family until it reached Othman Bin Talha.
                                <br><br>
                                Othman Bin Talha was a new muslim at that time. Many
                                years ago he refused to let Muhammad even enter the
                                Ka’bah and pray inside it like other people since he did
                                not believe him. When Muhammad returned to Makkah,
                                Othman had no choice but to give him the key and lose
                                the honour of keeping it.
                                <br><br>
                                At that moment many people asked Muhammad to grant
                                them the honour of keeping the key of the Ka’bah and
                                thousands of Muslims were looking at Muhammad to see
                                who would be the new custodian of the Ka’bah key.

                            <p>
                                Breaking a moment of silence, Muhammad opened the
                                door of the Ka’bah and cleared it of idols. He looked at
                                Othman Bin Talha and said to him (respecting previous
                                agreements):
                            </p>
                            <p class="italic">
                                “Today is a day of loyalty and piety! Take the key back. As
                                from now and until the Day of Judgment, no one can take it
                                from you (family of Bani Shayba) unless he was an aggressor.”

                                may be surprised to know that the key is still being held by
                                the offspring of Bani Shayba family until NOW!

                            <p>
                                More than 1400 years passed and the key is still given
                                from one generation of the Bani Shayba family to the next
                                generation. Until now, no one dares to take it from them
                                otherwise he or she would be considered as an “aggressor”
                                according to Muhammad’s description.

                                Nowadays, when the Saudi authorities perform their
                                annual cleaning and preparation of the Ka’bah for the
                                annual pilgrimage, they contact a person from the Bani
                                Shaybafamily (who is currently a Saudi family) to open the
                                Ka’bah door for them.

                                Karen Armstrong, the author of, “Muhammad: A Prophet
                                for Our Time”, indicated that we must approach the
                                life of Prophet Muhammad in a balanced way in order
                                to appreciate his considerable achievements. He had
                                important lessons, not only for Muslims, but also for the
                                Western people.

                                She also indicated that If we are to avoid catastrophe,
                                the Muslim and Western worlds must learn not merely to
                                tolerate but to appreciate one another. A good starting
                                point is the figure of Muhammad.
