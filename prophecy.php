                                        He led an ethical and ordinary life. He was known for his fidelity, integrity
                                        and
                                        trustworthiness. He never worshipped idols when idol worship was rife in a
                                        polytheistic
                                        society.
                                        <br>
                                        He always believed that the whole universe must have been created and controlled
                                        by one
                                        God. He used to worship God by retreating to a cave (634m above sea level) on a
                                        mount 4
                                        km east of Mecca (Makkah).
                                        <br>
                                        The cave is known as Hira cave which is on a mount called "Jabal Al Noor" (i.e.
                                        Mount of
                                        light). This is because Muhammad received the first revelation from God when he
                                        was
                                        meditating in this cave.

                                    When Muhammad reached forty years old, he used to meditate frequently in Cave Hira.
                                    At
                                    the month of Ramadan (the ninth month of the lunar year, 610 CE approx), Archangel
                                    Gabriel appeared to him for the first time while he was in the cave and asked him to
                                    “Read”. Muhammad was frightened.<br><br>
                                    As he was illiterate, he could not read and did not know what to read. Archangel

                                    repeated his word “read” again and again then he recited the following verses from
                                    God:

                                    Christian person and knowledgeable in the Bible. Waraqa predicted that Muhammad

                                    a Prophet and assured him that what he experienced was a divine revelation similar
