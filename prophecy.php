                                He led an ethical and ordinary life. He was known for his fidelity, integrity and
                                trustworthiness. He never worshipped idols when idol worship was rife in a polytheistic
                                society.

                                God. He used to worship God by retreating to a cave (634m above sea level) on a mount 4
                                km east of Mecca (Makkah).

                                light). This is because Muhammad received the first revelation from God when he was
                                meditating in this cave.

                                When Muhammad reached forty years old, he used to meditate frequently in Cave Hira. At
                                the month of Ramadan (the ninth month of the lunar year, 610 CE approx), Archangel
                                Gabriel appeared to him for the first time while he was in the cave and asked him to
                                “Read”. Muhammad was frightened.<br><br>
                                As he was illiterate, he could not read and did not know what to read. Archangel Gabriel
                                repeated his word “read” again and again then he recited the following verses from God:

                                Muhammad was afraid that he was possessed by evil. He went with his wife Khadijah to
                                tell the whole story to Waraqa Bin Nawfal (a relative of Khadijah) who was a religious
                                Christian person and knowledgeable in the Bible. Waraqa predicted that Muhammad would be
                                a Prophet and assured him that what he experienced was a divine revelation similar to
                                what Moses the Prophet of Jews received. Waraqa wished to support Muhammad but he was
                                very old at that time. He told Muhammad that he would be driven out of Makkah by his own
                                people and would be treated with hostility by some people.

                                Shariah is divided into three main branches: (1) Worship: such as daily prayers,
                                fasting, supplications, giving Zakat (alms), etc. (2) Life transactions and dealings
                                with others such as rules of justice, people’s rights, commerce and business ethics,
                                inheritance, etc. (3) Morals: such as right actions, etiquettes and values (honesty,
                                sincerity, fidelity, love, cooperation, etc).

                                            God sent us a messenger from among ourselves, a man whose origin, honesty,
                                            integrity and chastity were well known to us. He called upon us to worship
                                            God alone and leave away the stones and idols which we worshipped as our
                                            forefathers had done. He instructed us to be truthful in our words, to

                                            and he forbade us from committing abominations. So we trusted & believed him
                                            and followed the message he received from God. However, our people denounced

                                Testament. For example, the name Quddous in Arabic is similar to the name Qadosh or

                                Linguistically the word “Islam” in Arabic comes from the root word “salama”, which means

                                            Prophet Muhammad defined a Muslim as “the one whom other people are safe
                                            from harm coming from his tongue and hands”, i.e. people should not receive
                                            any harm from his actions and words.

                                In Islam, “The Peace” is one of the magnificent names and attributes of God (Allah). The
                                one who submits to Allah should find inner peace within him/ herself and should be at
                                peace with the environment and the people.

                                It is interesting to know that in a Muslim society, people greet each other with the
                                word “ Assalamo Alaykom” which means “peace be upon you” instead of the words “Hi” or
                                “Hello”. The full version of this statement is “peace be upon you as well as Allah’s
                                mercy and blessings”.

                                life is called a “Muslim” i.e. the one who believed in one God and submitted to Him.
